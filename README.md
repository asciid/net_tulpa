# [net://tulpa]

Compilation of translation articles about tulpa's phenomenon: creating, developing and putting them into a form whether it is a voice, visual image or feeling of a touch.

Articles have been already compiled and stored at http://2upkqblj3zd5f2nl.onion/ (use Tor Browser) so big thanks and shouts out to site's owner(s) and poster(s). They did damn huge job and there is even historical references to daemonism in ancient Greek's philosophy.

It is worth seing even if you don't want to experiment with your mind. This way you can learn a lot about yourself and people around you, especially their and your thoughts. Just take a look. And welcome!

Thanks to `deadlocked` for assisting during the translating, `expl0iter` for idea of a project (he found that .onion-link when he was wandering the net) and to my beloved Diana. You are a driver for my heart to turn unspoken depth of my love into the warmth of your touch. I love you. You are the one <3.
