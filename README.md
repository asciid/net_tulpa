## About

Compilation of translation articles about tulpa's phenomenon: creating, developing and putting them into a form whether it is a voice, visual image or feeling of a touch.

Articles have been already compiled and stored at http://2upkqblj3zd5f2nl.onion/ (use Tor Browser) so big thanks and shouts out to site's owner(s) and poster(s). They did damn huge job and there is even historical references to daemonism in ancient Greek's philosophy.

It is worth seing even if you don't want to experiment with your mind. This way you can learn a lot about yourself and people around you, especially their and your thoughts. Just take a look. And welcome!

## Style

I've decided to create my own vocabulaty for the translation.

I've been wandering the Russian tulpa comminity for a long time so I can say that it has **no Russian terms**. Usually people use a lot of anglicisms and it is not okay when you can use a word in your mother tongue. For example, sometimes you can hear something like: "Я был в вондере". It can be translated as "I've been in the Wonderland", and the word "вондер" means nothing to the one who don't know the tulpa terms while "Wonderland" can mean a dream so an interlocutor can understand you.

Some members of the Community tell me that translated terms don't sound great. Then, there are a lot of words in Russian that sound so. If you think for a while about how the word is formed and of what parts it consists, you can even conclude that every word sucks. If you support such an argument to lend words from another language, think so, it is your right.

**I don't want to cause an holy war in the tulpa/translating community!**

It is my peronal thoughts about how the translation should be done so if someone disagrees me, he should make a fork and don't fuck with my opinion.

## Shouts out

Thanks to `deadlocked` for assisting during the translating, `expl0iter` for idea of a project (he found that .onion-link when he was wandering the net) and to my beloved Diana. You are a driver for my heart to turn unspoken depth of my love into the warmth of your touch. I love you. You are the one <3.
