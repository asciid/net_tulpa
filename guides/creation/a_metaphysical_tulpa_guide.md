A Metaphysical Tulpa Guide

---

Hey everyone, Agent_Nycto here. This is going to be some pretty deep shit that we are talking about in here, covering some basic metaphysical theories, how they apply to tulpas, and even techniques to get you started. There’s going to by funny pictures. There’s going to be tears. There will be laughter. There may even be a quiz at the end (http://i.imgur.com/rh8feBw.jpg).

But first…

IF YOU DISAGREE WITH METAPHYSICAL THOUGHT, AND WANT TO BE A DICK ABOUT IT, READ THE EVERLOVING FUCK OUT OF THE FOLLOWING.

Look, I get it. We. All. Get. It. There is absolutely no concrete, scientific proof for any of this. I said it. Right there. You don’t have to tell us. We know we could very well be wrong about all of this. Everything that anyone has ever really gotten has been personal anecdotes and experiences, and some of this stuff is even untestable.

And that’s ok.

Even if someone else is thinking something that’s stupid, that’s ok. You don’t have to make yourself look like an asshole by yelling at people for feeling a certain way. No one is trying to force this down your throat, no one has a gun to your head (I’m assuming). This whole post is tagged as metaphysical, so if you’re not down with it, you don’t have to tell us that we are all wrong and stupid for thinking about it.

Here’s an alternative, if you absolutely feel the need to tell someone they are stupid, or demand proof, or cause a conflict or whatthefuckever (http://i.imgur.com/H7v8Lp8.jpg)…

Hit back on your browser and read something else.

Anything that you say will just make yourself look bad, and it will offend some other people. We’re all into tulpas, so we’re all out on the same limb here. What you think is possible other people think is pants-on-head retarded, too. If you really, absolutely, cannot-do-without-talking shit about this or have a pointed question or whatever, sure, you can message me (http://i.imgur.com/QS68KpR.jpg). I reserve the right to rip you a new asshole if you’re a twat waffle, but if you have genuine questions or anything, I will answer them. Just know you’ll be getting the same treatment you give me.

IF YOU AGREE WITH METAPHYSICAL THOUGHT, BUT STILL WANT TO BE A DICK ABOUT THIS GUIDE, READ THE EVERLOVING FUCK OUT OF THE FOLLOWING.

This is, in my opinion, boiling everything down to it’s basic core theory. You, however, might have some different ideas on how things work, and will possibly disagree with me about something. That’s cool. But the same rule for the people who aren’t into this applies to you. Don’t be an asshat. There’s no reason to pick a fight with me, or anyone else, if you disagree with them. If you think everything I did was wrong in this, then write your own damned guide. I really don’t care (http://i.imgur.com/uQCWr8M.gif). If you have questions or comments you want to ask somewhere other than on here, yeah, feel free to message me. But just like above, expect the same treatment you give out.

FUCK ALL OF THESE WARNINGS, JUST DON’T BE AN ASSHOLE (http://i.imgur.com/iR712Se.jpg).

So (http://youtu.be/dEtm_Q2LK9g)… the guide.

METAPHYSICAL SHIT. HOW (http://i.imgur.com/EaIsqVU.png) THE FUCK DOES THAT WORK?

Magic (http://i.imgur.com/2AOzort.gif).

FUCK YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION.

Actually, I did. But here’s the idea behind it. Living things make energy. It looks exactly like this (http://i.imgur.com/PXaYssC.png), with no exaggerations whatsoever. When you burn off stuff that you eat, get pumped up because your teamsports have scored a pointsgoal, see a sideboob, or whatever, you are generating this energy. Some people call it Chi, some Ki, some Souldiarrhea, or whatever. It’s the same shit. You can feel it when you have any strong emotional reaction to something, or when you’re done fapping.

Also, pretty fucking much everything is made up of and radiates this shit. Some stuff, people think, is better at making it, and making different kinds of energy. This is why people dig them magical rocks and crystals so much, in theory they produce specific wavelengths, colors, or types of energy that does certain things. This is also true for certain places, and in a way, that sort of makes sense. There’s a lot more energy flying around at a natural waterfall than a cubicle farm, and it’s got a different type of feel than a rave or a metal concert.

You can, with practice, do a whole lot of shit. You can sense energy within yourself more, you can control how much you make, either more or less, you can sense it around you. You can also learn to make your energy do all sorts of shit… basically… WHATEVER YOU FUCKING WANT. It’s yours and a part of you, so who the fuck cares? You can make it into a ball or a cube or toss it around or throw it out into the universe to do who knows what. And that, basically, how magic works. Energy+intent.

WHAT ABOUT ALL THE BLOOD RITES AND SIGILS AND CHANTING AND JERKING OFF ON ROCKS AND OTHER BULLSHIT (http://i.imgur.com/9nNaJYy.jpg)?

That is exactly why this is the bullshit free guide. All of that other crap is just so that you can put yourself into a proper mindset and raise energy better. You don’t need it. At all. It can help, sure, but basically it’s all just raising energy and making it do shit. Sometimes it’s to get the attention of certain deities or for religious reasons. But basically anyone who tells you that you have to draw some bullshit circle in the ground and drink dogs blood in a baseball field, they are full of shit (http://i.imgur.com/Wd2Mi3H.png).

RIGHT, COOL, SO HOW THE FUCK DOES THIS APPLY TO TULPAS?

In this thought process, they are simply energy that you have made, by focusing on it constantly, that you have programmed sentience into. Bi-zam (http://i.imgur.com/dvdv3tS.gif). You just made a sentient thoughtform.
And if you’re super advanced, you can even give it the ability to make it’s own damned energy, so you have made, essentially, a spirit. Tied to you as much or as little as you guys want, in the kinkiest or non-kinkiest connotations thereof (http://i.imgur.com/ogrzB0s.jpg).

METAPHYSICAL SHIT COMPARED TO PSYCHOLOGICAL SHIT. GO (http://i.imgur.com/RBlIU80.jpg).

So if you know anything about the two, this means that you’ve probably figured out the biggest difference is that in pychthought, the tulpa is still a part of your mind. In metathought, it’s an actual, different, living THING. Sure on the energy/astral/whatever level, but it’s a real, separate entity. Hypothetically, according to metathought, you can get your tulpa to help out with all sorts of shit that you couldn’t if you just had another sentient personality in your head.

BUT HOW CAN EVERYONE HUG (http://i.imgur.com/h9OmHts.png) AND GET ALONG?

That’s right, neither side has to fight each other, because EVERYONE CAN BE WRONG (http://youtu.be/2yqUpypQwGs).

If you’re metathought, you can assume that people using psych techniques are raising energy and focusing it into a thoughtform.

If you’re psychthought, you can assume that the people using metathought are just doing something that helps their mental focus in making a tulpa.

Or, you know, everyone can assume that their way is the best, and that the people using the other methods are just delusional about how it really works (http://i.imgur.com/ILQ6aDa.jpg).

So there you have it. People and stuff can make energy, you can learn to do stuff with that energy via willpower, and you can take energy and make it sentient, which makes it a tulpa.

BUT HOW CAN I DO? (http://i.imgur.com/Df8T7as.jpg)

So you want to try it? First go meditate. There’s a bajillion guides out there. Then, focus on yourself. Try to remember something that got you excited, like a roller coaster. Try to capture that feeling again, the rush, the exhilleration. Focus on that feeling, and try to sense the energy that is starting to work up inside of you.Some people say it feels like a warmth, other people say it feels like a tingling or electricity.

Congrats (http://i.imgur.com/QWHFUCa.jpg), you just figured out what your energy feels like.

If you practice you can summon it out of nowhere, without even having to remember anything or sit down and focus.

If you have anything constructive or entertaining to say or ask, feel free to comment below. If not, you can cram it up your ass and twist.

EDIT Put in the mentions of “being a dick about it” in the bold text up top, because there are people from both sides of the theory who don’t need that warning, because they weren’t planning on being dicks about it. Thanks /u/reguile!
