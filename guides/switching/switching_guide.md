Switching Guide

---

So, In light of our recent success at switching, Storm and I are making a guide for switching. Essentially how we did it was that I relaxed until I got to just the edge of sleep, and then Storm took over. Your tulpa needs to be able to possess, full body possession is best; they also need to be able to remain active without you directly paying attention to them. In our experience, the tulpa does the most work here, but the host has an important role too. Please note that this is how we do it, and that Your Mileage Might Vary.

    1) Relax, get comfortable, turn off the lights if you have to. You don’t need to actually sleep, but you do need to get relaxed enough to where you can drift off. Mostly what needs to happen is that the host needs to “get out of the way”, so to speak.

    2) Eventually, you will get to a point where you don’t feel like moving, or possibly even thinking; this is where Storm steps in, and I drift off.
    It’s very much like when you fall alseep infront of a movie or tv, you stop paying attention for a while before you actually fall asleep.

    3) “For the tulpas: I don’t know exactly how I do it, but it’s just like possessing the body. I just kinda take control, and Poof done. I just kinda took control, and he never took it back.”

    4) Now for the hosts: you need to relax, and just let them take over. I found that even when she was in control, I was still somewhat aware of what was going on. Just let it all go by, give it no attention.

    5) Have fun! Post a reply if it worked for you, we’d love to hear your stories!

Thanks to TheOtherTulpa and [Amir] for sharing their experiences and making this a little less one-sided to start.

N.B.: I will edit this for typos and more info that comes along, so don’t hesitate to share what worked for you.
