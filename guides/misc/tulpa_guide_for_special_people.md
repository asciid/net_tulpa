Tulpa Guide for Special People

---

So, the first guide is SO LONG and SO HARD to understand, right? Well in this snarky sequel, I’ll make it easier to understand for people that aren’t very good English speakers, morons, and young people who don’t know English beyond OMG. So, without further a due, here I go.

So, you want to make a tulpa. Here I will tell you how. This is not paranormal or supernatural, but rather a mental thing. No, this is not a mental disorder or an imaginary friend. You see and experience your tulpa like a normal person. Do not follow this guide perfectly- you don’t have to. Instead, please make sure you just get to every step so you don’t miss anything important. Making a tulpa is hard, and takes a long time. It took me 130 hours (2 and a half months). This is my method, and there are other methods out there you can try, okay?

When you make a tulpa do not work on it for more than three hours a day, or else you will feel very exhausted and not be able to function well. Making a tulpa is very hard on the brain, and if you’re not used to visualizing things, then it may result in headaches and feeling very tired. This is normal, don’t worry. Don’t work on your tulpa for less than a half hour a day, because so little time is not very constructive. You can spread the time out throughout the day, but make sure you’re not making the sessions last less than 20 minutes.

Before you do anything you want to work on personality. Think about all the traits, likes, dislikes, biases, point of views, prejudices and everything you want your tulpa to have. What I did, is I turned this all into a sort of ball and focuses on each part of the personality until I knew it back to front. What you do may be different, because personality is highly personal, and is generally different for everyone. Please do this first, before even visualizing. This should take around 3 to 10 hours. People like to skip this, but please don’t.

Next what you want to do is think about the form you want your tulpa to have. It should not be a living person, a dead person, a character, or yourself. It can be an animal, a rock, a person or anything else you can possibly think of, excluding the above. Just make it something you want to have for the rest of your life, and something that isn’t a fleshed out character. The problem with the latter is that you’ll be applying your ideas about the character to the tulpa, which will make it so it might not grow into its own being. This is generally a bad thing.

Unlike Irish’s method I did not use a wonderland. What I did was sit down, look at the area in front of me, close my eyes and then imagine the tulpa on the area. I think this is a better method for people that don’t want to imagine an entire world and a tulpa. When you first make a tulpa, you should think about it naked initially. Because if you don’t, whatever clothes you put them in will become part of their form and they won’t be able to change. You should only make them naked for the first half hour of visualization.

With visualization you strive to really focus on your tulpa’s appearance until you can see it perfectly in your head. You should be looking at them from a “first person” point of view. This step is the easiest one for people to rush, but you should spend around 5 to 15 hours on it. More is always better, of course, and if you feel the need to spend more than 15 hours or so on visualization than that’s fine.

Now what you want to do is start getting a feel for the texture of your tulpa. You can either physically put your hands out or pretend to feel them, or just do it within your mind. Again, how you do this step is mostly up to you. This should take 5-15 hours regardless of how well you think you’re doing.

The next step in relation to sensory details is smell. You want to create a general smell for your tulpa. It can be as subtle or harsh as you want. Smell is important because of all our senses it triggers memory the best. Use this to your advantage! Skipping smell is something a lot of people like to do, but I feel it is very counteractive in the end. You only have to spend around 3 to 10 hours on smell.

This next part is something a lot of people think is fun, because up until now your tulpa should have been basically standing still. This, by contrast, may be more entertaining for the budding tulpaforcer. What you do, is you design your tulpa’s body language. How they walk, how they swing their arms, their posture and everything falls under this. Another thing you may want to do is to imagine their facial expressions for certain emotions. You don’t have to do every single emotion but you should be putting enough time into it that you have a pretty solid idea of what most of their facial expressions look like. This should take another 5-10 hours to master.

Okay, now we are done with the basics of creation. Just because all this is done, doesn’t mean you stop sitting down for X hours a day and working on your tulpa. Now you’re just putting each main trait together all into one. You should continue to do this until your tulpa is completely finished in every sense of the word.

During any of these steps you might have noticed your tulpa doing something on its own, or gotten a sudden wave of emotion seemingly from the tulpa. These are both sure signs of sentience and are very good. I did not get an emotional response until l hit around 50 hours in; so really, don’t expect something like this to happen so quickly.

Now we enter the stage of narration! Note that this does not in any way replace or nullify the sitting down and tulpaforcing. You still need to do that. With narration you basically want to be talking to your tulpa as much as you possibly can. Just make open ended conversation. Do not make up responses for them at any cost. This is called parroting and does not help you at all. In fact it hinders the creation of the separate consciousness. You can start narration any time you want, but I would not start until you’ve done at least visualization. That way you can hold and think about the image of the tulpa in your mind while narrating to them.

Some time around this period you may have the tulpa talk to you. It is very distinct from your own mind. This usually does not happen any time less than 25 hours into creation. For me, my tulpa did not talk to me until I was 70 hours into creation. It is generally different for everyone. Talking is also a sure sign that your tulpa has it’s own “mind”.

As for the voice of the tulpa, it will start out being very generic, think like the voices they program into a GPS. It will become more normal and distinct as time goes on. If you have some idea of what you want the voice to be, be sure to sort of apply it by imagining your tulpa saying random words in that voice. Otherwise it will just basically become what it becomes and you don’t have much control over that.

On another note, let’s talk about deviation in tulpae. Tulpae will often change during the creation process. They change in the earlier stages because they are matching up with your subconscious ideal. This can and will differ from what you consciously want. Later on, when they have proved themselves to be sentient, they may change themselves further. You should not mess with or try reversing the changes, because what you’re doing is basically forcing the tulpa into an identity it doesn’t want. This is for the better, and you should accept the changes with open arms.

Okay, so before we start the next part, the following should be true: Your tulpa talks to you in complete sentences, your tulpa has its own opinions, and your tulpa sometimes does things you wouldn’t expect. These are all signs of sentience.

Now, sit right back down on your ass. Tell your tulpa you are opening your mind to it, and imagine it walking through a door or something similar. This is when your tulpa will see your subconscious. From here on out it will know all your memories, how you feel, and pretty much everything about you as a person. You shouldn’t do this right off, wait until trust is built. That way it is more meaningful; your tulpa will not take it for granted.

Now, this is when we begin to impose the tulpa on our reality. Say you’re walking down the street. Imagine your tulpa just behind you, walking with you. Make sure you remember its gait. Do this almost at all times until it becomes natural. This took me a while to master. Next, start to impose the tulpa on your peripheral vision. It should never be fully seen, except for bits and pieces. Start to smell it, maybe have it brush your arm lightly or something. Force it upon all your senses, almost all the time. Soon enough, it will be there. This takes a while too and definitely don’t rush it. Finally, begin to fully see, hear, smell and touch your tulpa, keeping it in fully view. Seeing the entire thing is not as easy as just bits and pieces, but with the preparation the peripheral vision gave you it should not be too hard. At this point, until you have it perfectly, you should still be sitting down and imagining your tulpa in front of you daily, for a couple hours. Talking, and doing whatever you do.

You know this step is done when your tulpa looks completely real to you and everything.

Great, now you’re done making a tulpa. Now go learn English so you can appreciate the real guide.
